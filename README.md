AirBnB_clone - The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

## Objectives
After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Technologies used
- python [cmd, Flask]
- HTML
- CSS
- MySQL
